# Let's Chat
ASP.NET based chat application created during 10 Days HCL training camp.

front end is designed with the help of [Twitter Bootstrat](http://getbootstrap.com)
and for backend database I have used MySQL, the mechanism is to refresh the messages page every
Nth second to load new messages(I know that is NOT a good idea)

###Demo
Since .NET web hosting are not so much available I have hosted this on [Somee.com](http://somee.com)
they have a database limit of 5MB so it keep getting database errors.

###TODO
  * Move the code to better hosting server
  * Use a push technology to show new messages
